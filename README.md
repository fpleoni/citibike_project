# Bikes of New York

For this project I used the publicly available datasets from [Citi Bike's](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) website to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis**, looking for something to report on.

The final result of this project can be found on the following blogpost: [Bikes of New York](https://towardsdatascience.com/bikes-of-new-york-6e0bbe5507f8), along with some cool visualizations and videos summarizing my findings.

In this repo:
  - **src**: Jupyter Notebooks with all the code for the project
  - **data**: CSV files containing the cleaned DataFrames
